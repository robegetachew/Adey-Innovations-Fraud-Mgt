# Fraud Detection Data Preprocessing
This repository contains a script to preprocess and analyze fraud detection data. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, cleaning data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), merging datasets for geolocation analysis, feature engineering, normalization and scaling, and encoding categorical features.

## Files
eda.py: The main script containing all the preprocessing functions.
Fraud_Data.csv: The dataset containing fraud detection data.
IpAddress_to_Country.csv: The dataset containing IP address ranges and corresponding countries.
## Preprocessing Steps
1. Handling Missing Values
The handle_missing_values function imputes missing values for numerical columns with the mean and drops rows with missing values for categorical columns.
2. Data Cleaning
The clean_data function removes duplicates, corrects data types, and converts the ip_address column to the appropriate format.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The univariate_analysis and bivariate_analysis functions perform univariate and bivariate analysis on relevant columns.
4. Merge Datasets for Geolocation Analysis
The merge_datasets function converts IP addresses to integer format and merges Fraud_Data.csv with IpAddress_to_Country.csv based on IP address ranges.
5. Feature Engineering
The feature_engineering function creates new features such as transaction frequency, velocity, and time-based features (hour_of_day, day_of_week).
6. Normalization and Scaling
The normalize_and_scale function normalizes and scales numerical features to ensure consistency.
7. Encode Categorical Features
The encode_categorical_features function performs one-hot encoding for categorical features (source, browser, sex).
## Usage

### Import the Modules:

python
```
from eda import (handle_missing_values, clean_data, univariate_analysis, 
                             bivariate_analysis, merge_datasets, feature_engineering, 
                             normalize_and_scale, encode_categorical_features)
import pandas as pd
```

### Load the Data:
```
python
fraud_df = pd.read_csv('Fraud_Data.csv')
ip_df = pd.read_csv('IpAddress_to_Country.csv')
```
### Preprocessing Steps:

python
```
fraud_df = handle_missing_values(fraud_df)
fraud_df = clean_data(fraud_df)
univariate_analysis(fraud_df)
merged_data = merge_datasets(fraud_df, ip_df)
merged_data = feature_engineering(merged_data)
bivariate_analysis(merged_data)
merged_data = encode_categorical_features(merged_data)
merged_data = normalize_and_scale(merged_data)
```
## View Processed Data:
```
python
print(merged_data.head())
```

## Conclusion
This script performs comprehensive data preprocessing for fraud detection analysis, making the data suitable for machine learning algorithms.

# adey-ecommerce-banking-fraud-detection
To improve the detection of fraud cases for e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions. This project aims to create accurate and strong fraud detection models that handle the unique challenges of both types of transaction data. It also includes using geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition to improve detection.
# Core Objectives
This project will involve:
- Analyzing and preprocessing transaction data.
- Creating and engineering features that help identify fraud patterns.
